#E-Differences between an interpreter and a compiler:
#Interpreter Translates program one statement at a time, while compiler Scans the entire program and translates it as a whole into machine code. .
#Programming language like Python, Ruby use interpreter, Programming language like C, C++ use compilers.
#Interpreter takes less amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time is slower, while compilre takes large amount of time to analyze the source code but the overall execution time is comparatively faster.
#F-Python 3.0 was released in 2008. The final 2.x version 2.7 release came out in mid-2010, with a statement of extended support for this end-of-life release. The 2.x branch will see no new major releases after that. 3.x is under active development and has already seen over five years of stable releases, including version 3.3 in 2012, 3.4 in 2014, 3.5 in 2015, and 3.6 in 2016. This means that all recent standard library improvements, for example, are only available by default in Python 3.x.
#G-ASCII codes represent text in computers, communications equipment, and other devices that use text. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, though they support many additional characters.
#G-UTF-8 is a character encoding capable of encoding all possible characters, or code points, defined by Unicode. The encoding is variable-length and uses 8-bit code units.
